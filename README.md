# Neural-Network
~ Implemented the two layer neural network for m-samples and n-features using forward and backward propagation.

~ Implemented the same for N-layers in the hidden layer.

~ Calculated all the evaluation matrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score and Confusion Matrix.

~ Implemented teh same for one more activation function: tanh function
